        <div class="image-title">Czechoslovak and Soviet Film Screening Patterns in Brno Cinemas (1951–1953)</div>
        <div class="image-description">Brno – This comparison examines the proportions of Czechoslovak and Soviet film productions in terms of their presence in cinema schedules (dark green/red) and the number of screening days they accounted for (light green/red) in individual cinemas between 1951 and 1953. The graphs reveal that Czechoslovak films, while less frequently shown, contributed a larger share of total screening time in most cinemas. In contrast, Soviet films appeared more often in cinema schedules but occupied a smaller proportion of total screening time.
